Tutorials for programming in Lua, specifically for modern Total War games by Creative Assembly.

# Total War: Lua

Hello!

This is a series of tutorials meant to take you on your merry way, from someone who may not know how programming works at all, to someone who is able to create mods using the available programming language in the Total War series, Lua. You are not expected to know how to write, think, or problem-solve like a programmer - that is the explicit intention of this tutorial, to guide you on that journey.

# Background Knowledge
That said, I need to make some assumptions on background knowledge *before* these tutorials.

**Mods**: You should know what they are, generally what they can do, and generally how they are made. This tutorial series won't get into creating, bundling, or distributing pack files; this tutorial won't cover the tools therein. You should come with that in advance.
**Total War**: You should know what the game we're modding even is.
**Language and Logic Skills**: You should be able to read these words and think about what they mean.

And that's quite it. You are not expected to have any background in the computer sciences, in mathematics, in logic, game design, none of that.

# Tutorial Goals
The parameters of this tutorial are fairly simple. My intention here is to take anyone who wishes to improve their Lua scripting ability, regardless of their skill level (or any existence therein), to the highest level possible.

I firmly believe the best way to do this is to build a rock-solid foundation, and build up. As with any lexical language, programming languages require an investment of time and a lot of repetition. It requires learning the new sounds, structure, and syntax of the language. You need to learn how to read, write, and even think in that language.

In so doing, the goal is to build a tutorial series that builds up a firm base of knowledge, slowly introducing new concepts as they're relevant. Programming is a skill that takes time to hone, and this is not the tutorial series to read if you simply want "results fast". If you're interested in learning, take it slowly, methodically, patiently, and you'll get there.

# Tutorial Structure
Before getting into the Total War side of things, there needs to be a good amount of focus on the Lua side of things. Before any scripts are run that interact with units or factions or what have you, scripts will need to run in their own separate world outside of the game. As soon as possible, though, the tutorials will build to integrate, increasingly, the Total War specific details, and give a fuller picture of how to work in this environment.
